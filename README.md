# mongodb101js_week1
Challenge project for week one of mongodb101js.

To run this app, clone the project and then run npm install from the root project directory.

The goal for the first course week was to get a minimum of experience working with the mongodb driver for node.js, express.js, in addition to more experience working with node and javascript.

The application connects to a local, pre-existing mongodb database named video.movies.

The user can add new movies to the database by giving the title, year, and imdb identification number for the film.
