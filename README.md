# mongodb101js_week1
Challenge project for week one of mongodb101js.

To install:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/kbendick/mongodb101js_week1.git
$ npm install
```

The application connects to a local, pre-existing mongodb database named video.movies.

The user can add new movies to the database by giving the title, year, and imdb identification number for the film.

The user sees a success message if the file was added

The goal for the first course week was to get a minimum of experience working with the mongodb driver for node.js, express.js, in addition to more experience working with node and javascript.

Obviously, I didn't put in much effort to make the application look very nice as that wasn't the learning goal for the project. Later in the course, I plan to do that with more involved projects pending I have free time. 

It's also obviously a massively bad idea to use any of this code for anything that matters to you at all =).
